# Welcome to Moorhead Bicycle!
An e-commerce site built using MySQL and PHP.  

This project was the culmination of the Database Systems course I completed in pursuit of my Master's in Computer Science. In the course, I learned many important concepts about database administration and design, including

* Normalization
* Conceptual data modeling using ER diagrams
* Designing an efficient relational database schema
* Implementing the theory of relational databases in a real-world application project

Using the theory of functional dependencies, I was able to develop a well-designed database system in which most tables are in BCNF, and all tables are in at least 2NF. I implemented my database design using MySQL and PHP on Montclair State University's cPanel server. The final product can be viewed [here.](cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~moorhjef)
