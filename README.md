# Welcome to Moorhead Bicycle!
An e-commerce site built using MySQL and PHP.  

This project was the culmination of the Database Systems course I completed in pursuit of my Master's in Computer Science. In the course, I learned many important concepts about database administration and design, including

* Normalization
* Conceptual data modeling using ER diagrams
* Designing an efficient relational database schema
* Implementing the theory of relational databases in a real-world application project

Using the theory of functional dependencies, I was able to develop a well-designed database system in which most tables are in BCNF, and all tables are in at least 2NF. I implemented my database design using MySQL and PHP on Montclair State University's cPanel server. The main purpose of this project was to develop database design and PHP skills, so the front-end is basic, although I plan to add CSS and JavaScript to the page to create a more aesthetic user interface. 
  
**NOTE: Moorhead Bicycle is not associated with any currently operating business. No payment information is ever requested and no orders placed on the site will be fulfilled with physical products.**  
  
On your first visit to the Moorhead Bicycle store front, you will be asked to create a user account.

Once you have created your user account, you will be able to access the store, where you can purchase bicycles, clothing, and accessories.</br>

Next, you are able to place orders, and view past orders you have made.

Finally, as part of the requirements of this project, I have included some basic human resources functionality, including the ability for salespeople to view customer information and existing orders, and the ability for administrators to register new employee accounts. </br>

Overall, I am very happy with the work I put into this project. From this project I gained valuable knowledge on database design, MySQL, and PHP and look forward to being able to develop those skills further professionally.
