# Welcome to Moorhead Bicycle!
An e-commerce site built using MySQL and PHP.  

This project was the culmination of the Database Systems course I completed in pursuit of my Master's in Computer Science. In the course, I learned many important concepts about database administration and design, including

* Normalization
* Conceptual data modeling using ER diagrams
* Designing an efficient relational database schema
* Implementing the theory of relational databases in a real-world application project

Using the theory of functional dependencies, I was able to develop a well-designed database system in which most tables are in BCNF, and all tables are in at least 2NF. I implemented my database design using MySQL and PHP on Montclair State University's cPanel server. The final product can be viewed [here.](http://cyan.csam.montclair.edu/~moorhjef) The main purpose of this project was to develop database design and PHP skills, so the front-end is basic, although I plan to add CSS and JavaScript to the page to create a more aesthetic user interface. 
  
**NOTE: Moorhead Bicycle is not associated with any currently operating business. No payment information is ever requested and no orders placed on the site will be fulfilled with physical products.**  
  
On your first visit to the Moorhead Bicycle store front, you will be asked to create a user account.

Once you have created your user account, you will be able to access the store, where you can purchase bicycles, clothing, and accessories.</br>

Next, you are able to place orders, and view past orders you have made.

Finally, as part of the requirements of this project, I have included some basic human resources functionality, including the ability for salespeople to view customer information and existing orders, and the ability for administrators to register new employee accounts. </br>

Overall, I am very happy with the work I put into this project. From this project I gained valuable knowledge on database design, MySQL, and PHP and look forward to being able to develop those skills further professionally.
